# Slicer-Settings

These are my config files for PrusaSlicer 2.7.0.

I use these profiles on my Voron 2.4R2 350mm and Voron 0.2S1 120 mm printers. These printers have several upgraded components that allow me to push them a bit faster than stock.

I provide these as a reference only.

Please DO NOT blindly apply these configuration settings in your own slicer without a good amount of incremental testing, as you can harm your printer.

Warning: Use at your own risk!
