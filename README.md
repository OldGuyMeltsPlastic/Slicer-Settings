# Slicer-Settings

These are my config files for PrusaSlicer 2.6.0.

I use these profiles on my Voron 2.4R2 350mm printer. That printer has several upgraded components that allow me to push it a bit faster than stock.

I provide these as a reference only.

Please DO NOT blindly apply these configuration settings in your own slicer without a good amount of incremental testing, as you can harm your printer.

Warning: Use at your own risk!
